Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project, Assignment Week 4:

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", 
available in coursera.

The goal is to prepare a tidy data set that can be used for later analysis.

The dataset being used is from the Human Activity Recognition database:  
                                (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)


Files:

IMPORTANT: The code requires the user to set their own working directory in line 6 of the code before running it.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
	    
run_analysis.R contains the code to perform the analyses.

The code can be copied into R or R-studio, the working directory entered into the code and run.

The output data file is called average_mean_labeled.txt and can befound in the working directory under: "./Assignment4/Results"
A copy of the output data file is uploaded in the course project's form.
